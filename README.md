# movie-generator-with-microservices

ğŸ“¹ this is a movie generator app, which would help you to find your proper movie!

##What I used  

 java 17,
 maven as a build tool (3.8.1 v)
 spring boot as my framework (3.1.2 v)
 spring mvc
 spring data JPA

 ## Explain the  Architecture
ğŸ’¡ Every microservice will register into the Eureka server and Eureka server
 knows all the client applications running on each port and IP address.

ğŸ’¡i also added api gateway API gateway which sits between the client apps and the microservices
and registered it to Eureka server.

ğŸ’¡so the request will go from user to api gateway and then it will manage the user requests
and send them to a proper microservice.
finally we will return the data.

ğŸ’¡the user DB is seperated from movies DB
