5: get movies by category and imdb also ordered by number of movies which user will request(if we had movies with same imdb and also the number of movies were equal to user request,
we return the movies. if we didn't have any movie which could fit with the imdb we return movies with higher imdb in ascending order. if DB had movies which matched with imdb
but the number of movies weren't equal to user request, first we return movies with similar imdb, then we add movies with higher imdb with ascending order)ðŸŒŸ
