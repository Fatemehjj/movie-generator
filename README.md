# movie-generator-with-microservices

ðŸ“¹ this is a movie generator app, which would help you to find your proper movie!

##What I used  

 java 17,
 maven as a build tool
 spring boot as my framework
 spring mvc
 spring data JPA

 ## Explain the  Architecture
ðŸ’¡ Every microservice will register into the Eureka server and Eureka server
 knows all the client applications running on each port and IP address.

ðŸ’¡i also added api gateway API gateway which sits between the client apps and the microservices
and registered it to Eureka server.

ðŸ’¡so the request will go from user to api gateway and then it will manage the user requests
and send them to a proper microservice.
finally we will return the data.

## Features
1: get movie by release date
2: get movie by name (you do not need to enter the full name, even with some alphabets it will work)
3: get movie by length (in some cases where the entered length is not found in the DB we return all movies with higher length)
4: get random movies order by number of movies which user will request
5:
